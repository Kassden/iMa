# iMa: Handicap Horse Racing Probability Estimation & Modeling

## Overview
Welcome to **iMa**, a repository dedicated to exploring probability estimation and modeling techniques in **handicap horse racing**. This project documents various approaches, statistical models, and simulations used to assess the likelihood of different race outcomes. The repository serves as both a learning resource and a testing ground for refining predictive methods in horse racing.

> **Note:** This work is based on the research of mathematician **Bill Benter** and his paper *Computer-Based Horse Race Handicapping and Wagering Systems: A Report* (William Benter, HK Betting Syndicate, Hong Kong).

## Objectives
- 📊 Develop and test models to estimate probabilities in **handicap horse racing**.
- 🔍 Analyze historical race data to uncover patterns and insights.
- 🤖 Compare different probability estimation techniques, including machine learning, Bayesian inference, and traditional statistical methods.
- 🛠 Provide a structured and reproducible framework for probability modeling in horse racing.

## Features
- 📝 **Jupyter Notebooks**: The repository primarily consists of Jupyter notebooks for easy experimentation and visualization.
- 📂 **Data Collection & Preprocessing**: Scripts and methodologies for gathering and cleaning race data.
- 🎲 **Probability Estimation Models**:
  - 📈 Statistical models (e.g., Elo, Poisson, logistic regression).
  - 🤖 Machine learning approaches (e.g., random forests, neural networks, gradient boosting).
  - 📊 Bayesian inference and Markov models.
- 🏇 **Handicap Adjustments**: Methods for incorporating weight penalties and race conditions into predictions.
- 🏆 **Simulations & Backtesting**: Testing models against historical races to evaluate accuracy and reliability.
- 📊 **Visualization & Insights**: Graphs and tools for understanding race dynamics and prediction effectiveness.
